## Technical Specifications

### Core Architecture
* **Target:** x86_64 / i686
* **Bootloader:** Limine
* **Executable Format:** ELF (External runner implemented as command 'run'. Currently runs broken snake.)
* **Toolchain:** GCC (MinGW-w64 / x86_64-elf-gcc), NASM

### Implemented Subsystems
* **Video:** VESA Framebuffer driver with hardware cursor support.
* **Input:** PS/2 Keyboard driver (supporting ASCII mapping and Shift modifiers).
* **Environment:** Basic Command Shell with windowing support.
* **Networking:** Initial internet stack testing (WIP).

## Build and Deployment

### Development Environment
The project requires a cross-compiler toolchain and the NASM assembler. Emulation is performed via QEMU.

### Build Instructions
Clean and full rebuild + run:
```bash
make cleanrun
```
Standard build:
```bash
make build
make iso
```

### Execution
Fast launch in QEMU:
```bash
make run
```

## Debugging and Diagnostics
For kernel-level debugging, use the following QEMU diagnostic flags:
```bash
qemu-system-x86_64.exe -cdrom equos.iso -d int,cpu_reset -no-reboot -no-shutdown 2> qemu_log.txt
```
To resolve symbols from the instruction pointer:
```bash
x86_64-elf-addr2line -e kernel.elf <address>
```

## Project Status
The OS is under active development. Development involves the use of LLM-assisted coding as part of the author's workflow.
